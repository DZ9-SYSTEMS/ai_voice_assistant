## Project Overview
Created by Isaiah Love, this AI Voice Assistant is an innovative project that integrates advanced speech recognition and response capabilities using Python. Leveraging the power of OpenAI's GPT-3, Google's Text-to-Speech (gTTS), and speech recognition libraries, this assistant can understand spoken commands and respond in a human-like manner. The project aims to simplify daily tasks through voice commands, making technology more accessible and interactive.

## Key Features
- Voice command recognition.
- Integration with OpenAI's GPT-3 for intelligent responses.
- Text-to-Speech conversion for audible feedback.
- Simple, user-friendly interface for everyday use.
